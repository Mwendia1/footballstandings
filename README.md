### Description  
The Football Standings Project is a web app that helps users explore football leagues and view their current standings.  
It shows available leagues, their teams, and rankings. Instead of searching manually,
users can quickly check the app and see the latest league tables and details.  

### Features  
- See all football leagues provided by the API.

- Click a league to view its current standings.

- Get team names, positions, wins, draws, and losses clearly displayed.

- Data is fetched from the Football Standings API so the information stays current.  

### Learning Goals  
- Learn how to fetch and display data from a public API.

- Gain experience using `fetch()` and handling promises. 

- Dynamically update the page with live football standings. 

- Add interactivity, like selecting leagues and exploring details.
